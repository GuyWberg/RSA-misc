# RSA-misc

Implementation of:
1. RSA encryption/decryption 
2. Miller-Rabin algorithm - a randomized algorithm for testing primality. 
3. Pollard's p âˆ’ 1 algorithm - a randomised number theoretic integer factorization algorithm. 
4. Wiener's attack - attack which uses the continued fraction method to expose the private key d when d is small.
5. Factorization of the modulus given the decryption and encryption keys. 


Files Descriptions
========================

1. RSA.jar - the executable file of the programm
2. User's Manual and theoretic background. 
3. Examples for encryption and decryption of a file (with parameters stated in the mannual).


How to start the program
========================

1. Open RSA.jar.
2. assuming java sdk is installed on the computer,if the jar file fails, open cmd in the ../Code direcroty and write run. (run.bat should start)

Note: the program was written in Java using Java JDK 1.8, on MacOS (the program was tested on Windows as well).
